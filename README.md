## Compatibility notes

This package has been tested with both laravel 9.x and 10.x versions.
However, from laravel v.10.10 the framework includes a `'type': 'module'` property in the package.json file that was not used on previous versions.

### Up to laravel v10.0

Install the package as described in the documentation above, no issues have been reported.

### From Laravel v.10.10 and up

When you install the package following the documentation above and then run `npm run dev` it returns an error due to a `require('path')` used in the `vite.config.js file`.

> If require('path') is replaced with `import path from 'path'` the dev server will return another error, mentioning the laravel() function being undefined. So, the import statement can be updated or not, it won't fix the issue.

To fix the issue you can:

-   remove from the laravel package.json file the `"type": "module"`
-   rename the vite.config.js file to `vite.config.cjs`

**please note** this is a temporary solution as in both cases, remove the type:module or renaming the vite config file could trigger other issues. If you face any problem please report it [here](https://github.com/fabiopacificicom/laravel-9-preset/issues)
